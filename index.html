<em>Specification</em> describes an interface between the operating system (OS) and the
platform <a href="GLOSSARY.html#firmware" class="glossary-term" title="Any software that is included in read-only memory (ROM).">firmware</a>. UEFI was preceded by the <em>Extensible <a href="GLOSSARY.html#firmware" class="glossary-term" title="Any software that is included in read-only memory (ROM).">Firmware</a> Interface
Specification 1.10</em> (<a href="GLOSSARY.html#efi" class="glossary-term" title="Extensible Firmware Interface. An interface between the operating system (OS)
and the platform firmware.">EFI</a>). As a result, some code and certain <a href="GLOSSARY.html#protocol" class="glossary-term" title="The information that defines how to access a certain type of device during boot
services. A protocol consists of a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID), a
protocol revision number, and a protocol interface structure. The interface
structure contains data definitions and a set of functions for accessing the
device. A device can have multiple protocols. Each protocol is accessible
through the device&#x2019;s handle.">protocol</a> names
retain the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#efi" class="glossary-term" title="Extensible Firmware Interface. An interface between the operating system (OS)
and the platform firmware.">EFI</a> designation. Unless otherwise noted, <a href="GLOSSARY.html#efi" class="glossary-term" title="Extensible Firmware Interface. An interface between the operating system (OS)
and the platform firmware.">EFI</a> designations in this
specification may be assumed to be part of UEFI.</p><p>The interface is in the <a href="GLOSSARY.html#form" class="glossary-term" title="Logical grouping of questions with a unique identifier.">form</a> of data tables that contain platform-related
information, and boot and runtime service calls that are available to the OS
loader and the OS. Together, these provide a standard environment for booting
an OS. This specification is designed as a pure interface specification. As
such, the specification defines the set of interfaces and structures that
platform <a href="GLOSSARY.html#firmware" class="glossary-term" title="Any software that is included in read-only memory (ROM).">firmware</a> must implement. Similarly, the specification defines the set
of interfaces and structures that the OS may use in booting. How either the
<a href="GLOSSARY.html#firmware" class="glossary-term" title="Any software that is included in read-only memory (ROM).">firmware</a> developer chooses to implement the required elements or the OS
developer chooses to make use of those interfaces and structures is an
implementation decision left for the developer.</p><p>The intent of this specification is to define a way for the OS and platform
<a href="GLOSSARY.html#firmware" class="glossary-term" title="Any software that is included in read-only memory (ROM).">firmware</a> to communicate only information necessary to support the OS boot
process. This is accomplished through a formal and complete abstract
specification of the software-visible interface presented to the OS by the
platform and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#firmware" class="glossary-term" title="Any software that is included in read-only memory (ROM).">firmware</a>.</p><p>Using this formal definition, a shrink-wrap OS intended to run on platforms
compatible with supported processor specifications will be able to boot on a
variety of system designs without further platform or OS customization. The
definition will also allow for platform innovation to introduce new features
and functionality that enhance platform capability without requiring new code
to be written in the OS boot sequence.</p><p>Furthermore, an abstract specification opens a route to replace legacy devices
and <a href="GLOSSARY.html#firmware" class="glossary-term" title="Any software that is included in read-only memory (ROM).">firmware</a> code over time. New device types and associated code can provide
equivalent functionality through the same defined abstract interface, again
without impact on the OS boot support code.</p><p>The specification is applicable to a full range of hardware platforms from
mobile systems to servers.  The specification provides a core set of services
along with a selection of <a href="GLOSSARY.html#protocol" class="glossary-term" title="The information that defines how to access a certain type of device during boot
services. A protocol consists of a Globally Unique Identifier (GUID), a
protocol revision number, and a protocol interface structure. The interface

interfaces can evolve over time to be optimized for various platform market
segments. At the same time, the specification allows maximum extensibility and
customization abilities for OEMs to allow differentiation. In this, the purpose
of UEFI is to define an evolutionary path from the traditional &#x201C;<a href="GLOSSARY.html#pc-at" class="glossary-term" title="Refers to a PC platform that uses the AT form factor for their motherboards.">PC-AT</a>&#x201D;-style
