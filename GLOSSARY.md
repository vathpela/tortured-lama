# _ADR
A reserved name in ACPI name space. It refers to an address on a bus that has
standard enumeration. An example would be PCI, where the enumeration method is
described in the PCI Local Bus specification.

## _CRS
A reserved name in ACPI name space. It refers to the current resource setting
of a device. A \_CRS is required for devices that are not enumerated in a
standard fashion.  \_CRS is how ACPI converts nonstandard devices into Plug and
Play devices.

## _HID
A reserved name in ACPI name space. It represents a device’s plug and play
hardware ID and is stored as a 32-bit compressed EISA ID. \_HID objects are
optional in ACPI. However, a \_HID object must be used to describe any device
that will be enumerated by the ACPI driver in the OS. This is how ACPI deals
with non–Plug and Play devices.

## _UID
A reserved name in ACPI name space. It is a serial number style ID that does
not change across reboots. If a system contains more than one device that
reports the same \_HID, each device must have a unique \_UID. The \_UID only
needs to be unique for device that have the exact same \_HID value.

## ACPI Device Path
A Device Path that is used to describe devices whose enumeration is not
described in an industry-standard fashion. These devices must be described
using ACPI AML in the ACPI name space; this type of node provides linkage to
the ACPI name space.

the concepts and technology it discusses. The specification defines a new
interface to the system board that enables the operating system to implement
operating system-directed power management and system configuration.

## Alt-GR Unicode
Represents the character code of a key when the Alt-GR modifier key is held
down.  This key (A2) in some keyboard layouts is defined as the right alternate
key and serves the same function as the left alternate key. However, in many
other layouts it is a secondary modifier key similar to shift. For instance,
key C1 is equated to the letter a and its Unicode character code in the typical
U.K. keyboard is a non-shifted character code of 0x0061. When holding down the
Alt-GR key in conjunction with the pressing of key C1, , the value on the same
keyboard often produces an á, which is a character code 0x00E1.

as UEFI applications and drivers on a given system. The boot manager would
typically be responsible for interacting with the system user, where
applicable, to determine what to load during system startup. In cases where
user interaction is not indicated, the boot manager would determine what to
load and, if multiple items are to be loaded, what the sequencing of such loads
would be.

Controller and installs both the PCI I/O Protocol and the Device Path Protocol
onto that handle.  It may optionally perform PCI Enumeration if resources have
not already been allocated to all the PCI Controllers on a PCI Host Bus
Controller. It also loads and starts any UEFI drivers found in any PCI Option
ROMs discovered during PCI Enumeration. If a driver is found in a PCI Option
ROM, the PCI Bus Driver will also attach the Bus Specific Driver Override
Protocol to the handle for the PCI Controller that is associated with the PCI
Option ROM that the driver was loaded from.

## PCI Bus
A collection of up to 32 physical PCI Devices that share the same physical PCI
bus.  All devices on a PCI Bus share the same PCI Configuration Space.

## PCI Configuration Space
The configuration channel defined by PCI to configure PCI Devices into the

registers in the form of a PCI Configuration Header, and can optionally produce
device specific registers. The registers are addressed via Type 0 or Type 1 PCI
Configuration Cycles as described by the PCI Specification. The PCI
Configuration Space can be shared across multiple PCI Buses. On most PC-AT
architecture systems and typical Intel ® chipsets, the PCI Configuration Space
is accessed via I/O ports 0xCF8 and 0xCFC.  Many other implementations are
possible.

The SAL_PCI_CONFIG_READ and SAL_PCI_CONFIG_WRITE procedures defined in chapter
9 of the SAL Specification define how to access the PCI Configuration Space in
a system that supports multiple PCI Segments. If a system only supports a
single PCI Segment the PCI Segment number is defined to be zero.

The existence of PCI Segments enables the construction of systems with greater
than 256 PCI buses.

## Pool Memory
A set of contiguous bytes. A pool begins on, but need not end on, an “8-byte”
boundary. Pool memory is allocated in pages—that is, firmware allocates enough
contiguous pages to contain the number of bytes specified in the allocation
request.  Hence, a pool can be contained within a single page or extend across
multiple pages.  Pool memory is allocated by EFI_BOOT_SERVICES.AllocatePool()
and returned by EFI_BOOT_SERVICES.FreePool().

## Preboot Execution Environment (PXE)
A means by which agents can be loaded remotely onto systems to perform
management tasks in the absence of a running OS. To enable the interoperability
of clients and downloaded bootstrap programs, the client preboot code must
provide a set of services for use by a downloaded bootstrap. It also must
ensure certain aspects of the client state at the point in time when the
bootstrap begins executing.  The complete PXE specification covers three areas;
the client, the network and the server.
### Client

  existing network infrastructure. proxyDHCP provides the additional DHCP
  information that is needed by PXE clients and Bootservers without making
  changes to existing DHCP servers.
- MTFTP: Adds multicast support to a TFTP server.
- Plug-In Modules: Example proxyDHCP and Bootservers provided in the PXE SDK
  (software development kit) have the ability to take plug-in modules (PIMs).
  These PIMs are used to change/enhance the capabilities of the proxyDHCP and
  Bootservers.
